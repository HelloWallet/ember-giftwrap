# [WIP] Ember Giftwrap

This is a work-in-progress. It's not ready yet.

# Why?

The Ember addons ecosystem is one of the best things about Ember. But
users stuck on legacy build systems have a hard time taking advantage
of it.

This tool is intended to be able to take *any* set of Ember addons and
package them in a standalone JS file that can be injected directly
into any Ember app, no matter how it was built.
